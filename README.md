# SpeakerSourceSeparation

A machine learning pipeline to isolate speaker audio from background noise using classical methods.

Features
- Implements REPET algorithm for initial noise reduction.
- Trains a model for voice enhancement on cleaned datasets.
- Automates data cleaning, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
- Achieves average PSNR of ~30 for separated audio.
- Interactive UI using GRADIO
